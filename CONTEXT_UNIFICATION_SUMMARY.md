# Context Unification Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Unified Context Manager (`modules/contextManager.js`)
- **Single source of truth** for all context management
- **Hierarchical context storage**: Server → Channel → Thread → Reply Chain
- **Per-server leaderboard context** (moved from per-channel)
- **Thread-specific context preservation**
- **Reply chain context** with proper depth limiting
- **Automatic cleanup** with TTL and size limits
- **Data persistence** for leaderboard history

### 2. Updated Context Builder (`modules/contextBuilder.js`)
- Refactored to use unified context manager
- Added thread context support
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Simplified interface with proper parameter passing

### 3. Updated Main Application (`index.js`)
- Replaced `channelContext` with `contextManager`
- Added proper thread context handling
- Updated all context building calls with appropriate parameters
- Fixed intent detection to use unified context

### 4. Updated All Handlers
- **ChatHandler**: Added thread context detection
- **MentionHandler**: Added thread context detection  
- **AskHandler**: Added thread context detection
- **LeaderboardHandler**: Now uses per-server context instead of per-channel

### 5. Updated Leaderboard Module (`modules/leaderboard.js`)
- Changed from per-channel to per-server leaderboard tracking
- Uses unified context manager for history
- Improved context summary formatting

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Unified Context System**
- Single `contextManager` handles all context types
- Consistent interface across all handlers
- Proper caching with automatic cleanup

### ✅ **Per-Server Leaderboard Context**
- Leaderboard context is now server-wide, not channel-specific
- Better tracking of server-wide ranking changes
- Persistent storage of leaderboard history

### ✅ **Thread Context Preservation**
- Proper context handling for Discord threads
- Thread-specific message history
- Automatic detection of thread vs channel context

### ✅ **Reply Stream Context**
- Enhanced reply chain tracking
- Works for both direct replies and intent-based replies
- Proper depth limiting to prevent excessive context

### ✅ **Performance Optimizations**
- Context caching with TTL (10 minutes)
- Size limits (30 messages max per context)
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Lazy loading of expensive operations

### ✅ **Data Persistence**
- Leaderboard history persisted to disk
- Automatic loading on startup
- Graceful handling of missing data

## Context Types Now Supported

1. **User Info Context**: Basic user and server information
2. **Channel Context**: Recent channel messages (non-thread)
3. **Thread Context**: Thread-specific message history
4. **Reply Chain Context**: Conversation chains from replies
5. **Leaderboard Context**: Server-wide leaderboard changes and available tags

## Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality is preserved:
- Existing handler interfaces unchanged
- Legacy methods available in contextBuilder
- Gradual migration path for any missed components

## No Functionality Broken

- All existing commands work as before
- Context building maintains same output format
- Handler behavior unchanged from user perspective
- Data migration handled automatically

## Cache Strategy

- **Memory-based caching** for active contexts
- **Automatic cleanup** every hour via existing cleanup interval
- **TTL-based expiration** (10 minutes for messages)
- **Size-based limits** (30 messages max per context type)
- **Hierarchical cleanup** (oldest messages removed first)

This unified system provides better performance, consistency, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

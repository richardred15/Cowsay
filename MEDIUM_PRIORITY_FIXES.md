# Medium Priority Fixes Applied

## Code Quality & Maintainability Improvements

### 1. Balatro.js Refactoring ✅
**Issue**: Long handleInteraction method handling multiple responsibilities
**Fix**: 
- Extracted `getGameForUser()` method for game retrieval logic
- Extracted `routeInteraction()` method for interaction routing
- Improved code organization and maintainability

### 2. TagManager.js Performance Optimization ✅
**Issue**: Frequent disk writes causing performance bottlenecks
**Fix**: 
- Implemented debounced saving with 1-second delay
- Reduced disk I/O frequency for high-frequency tag operations
- Added `debouncedSave()` method with timeout management

### 3. Blackjack.js Performance Optimization ✅
**Issue**: Inefficient deck creation for each game
**Fix**: 
- Cached base deck to avoid recreation
- Reuse base deck template with shallow copy
- Improved performance for multiple concurrent games

### 4. BattleshipClient.js Message Handling ✅
**Issue**: Inefficient callback lookup using loops
**Fix**: 
- Replaced loop-based message handling with efficient handler pattern
- Created dedicated handler methods for each message type
- Improved message processing performance

### 5. CharacterManager.js Caching ✅
**Issue**: Inefficient filtering of free characters on each call
**Fix**: 
- Implemented caching for free characters list
- Used Set for faster premium character lookups
- Reduced repeated filtering operations

### 6. GiftManager.js Query Optimization ✅
**Issue**: Using SELECT * instead of specific fields
**Fix**: 
- Optimized database query to fetch only required fields
- Reduced data transfer and improved query performance
- Changed from `SELECT *` to `SELECT item_id, name, price, category`

### 7. Pagination.js Naming & Configuration ✅
**Issues**: 
- Misleading variable name 'commands' for general items
- Hardcoded collector timeout
**Fixes**: 
- Renamed 'commands' to 'pageItems' for better clarity
- Added configurable `getCollectorTimeout()` method
- Made timeout configurable instead of hardcoded 60 seconds

### 8. GameManager.js Dynamic Game List ✅
**Issue**: Hardcoded game list inconsistent with actual games object
**Fix**: 
- Made `getAvailableGames()` derive from `this.games` object keys
- Eliminated potential inconsistencies between hardcoded list and actual games
- Improved maintainability when adding new games

## Performance Improvements Summary

- **Reduced Disk I/O**: Debounced saving in TagManager
- **Improved Caching**: Character lists and deck templates cached
- **Optimized Queries**: Specific field selection instead of SELECT *
- **Efficient Lookups**: Set-based lookups instead of array filtering
- **Better Message Handling**: Handler pattern instead of loop-based routing

## Code Organization Improvements

- **Method Extraction**: Long methods broken into focused functions
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Hardcoded values made configurable
- **Consistent Naming**: Variables renamed for clarity
- **Separation of Concerns**: Single-responsibility methods

## Impact

- **Performance**: Reduced CPU usage and memory allocation
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend code
- **Readability**: Clearer variable names and method purposes
- **Scalability**: Better handling of concurrent operations

All medium priority issues have been addressed while maintaining existing functionality and improving overall code quality.
